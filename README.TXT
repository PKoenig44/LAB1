1.  What test cases are needed, and in what order?

There are an insane amount of test cases needed for this lab since there
are so many objects to code but for the items you need to test
the description, rate and fees, and rental status; for the Lookup you need 
to test the matches method and for inventory test; add, remove, item count, find item, and rent 

2.  What did you not anticipate (e.g. time allocation, test cases,
    algorithms, methods)?
    
    The amount of test cases needed to completel test this lab 
    was exponentially more than what i was ready for as well as the level 
    of difficulty compared to COMP 111.
